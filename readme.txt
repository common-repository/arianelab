ArianeLab enables you to re-engage your customers through web push notifications. In under 5 minutes setup push notifications for your site.

== Description ==

Installing the ArianeLab plugin will insert a javascript code in your Wordpress website, thereby enabling you to use browser based push notifications. We have a comprehensive getting started guide on push notifications at https://www.arianelab.com.

ArianeLab is an all in one suite to engage and re-engage your web traffic. Firstly, it adds a smart notification pane on your website, which helps the on-site audience discover the latest content. Secondly, it leverages browser push notification technology to reach out to off-site customers. As compared to traditional re-engagement tools like emails, browser push notifications have been known to be 10x-50x more effective. All elements of ArianeLab are highly customizable to look like native elements of the page.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
